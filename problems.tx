cors issue with not conectiong correclty, back end with fetch from React
light and dark theme, components do not respond to the comand
when status of task get updated as project status and no logic work
i had to go over many times from project api, modals and input and output, diferent situations but no eyes to see,
that the issue was me changing status for tasks instead of project, so i endeed up loosing time just debugging for 
a small mistake.
