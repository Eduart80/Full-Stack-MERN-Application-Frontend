Frontend Project Plan
==================================

1. Project Setup & Structure
	- Initialize project with Vite + React + TypeScript
	- Organize folders: components, pages, assets, services, hooks, utils
	- Configure TypeScript, dotenv, Bootstrap, axios

2. UI/UX Design & Wireframes
	- Define user flows and main screens
	- Create wireframes or mockups with Figma
	- Bootstrap

3. Component Architecture
	- Identify reusable components Button, Input, Modal
	- Plan page-level components, Home, Dashboard, Profile, tasks, Completed, API
	- Define props and state for each component

4. State Management
	- React Context
	- Set up global state for user, theme, notifications, etc.

5. API Integration
	- Set up Axios for HTTP requests
	- Create service layer (security) for API calls 
	- Integrate with backend endpoints CRUD operations

6. Routing
	- Set up React Router for navigation
	- Define public and private routes
	- Handle 404 and error pages

7. Authentication & Authorization

	 - Prepare production build
	 - Deploy to Render
	 - Set up environment variables for CD proccess

Timeline
------------------------------
### Planning front-end 
- Day 1: Idea of the app, design, component<br>
scaffolding design, setup project structure
- Day 2: Building folder and structure based on requirement<br>
Install all neccesery libraries. Start Coding
- Day 3: Starting with App and chaining folders.<br>
Page, Component, Api, type, utils
- Day 4: Front & Back end working together. 
<br>Deploy with Render

 Notes & Additional Considerations
---------------------------------
- **Testing:** Even tests are not implemented, i will perform basic manual testing to ensure core features work as expected.
- **Buffer Time:** Allocate some buffer time in the schedule to handle unexpected issues, bug fixes, or last-minute changes.
- **Documentation:** Update the README and API documentation continuously as I develop the project to keep everything accurate and up to date.
